## 📖 Overview

**Classy Trash Monster (CTM)** is an educational game designed to teach **machine learning concepts** and **data dependency** to college students without technical backgrounds. Through interactive gameplay that simulates an ML pipeline, players learn how to train classification models, understand the impact of data quality on model performance, and grasp fundamental ML concepts—all without requiring programming knowledge.

### 🎯 Key Learning Objectives

- **ML Pipeline Understanding**: Experience data collection, model training, and evaluation
- **Data Dependency**: Learn how data quality and balance affect model performance
- **Classification Concepts**: Understand how ML models learn to categorize data
- **Practical ML Skills**: Apply ML concepts through hands-on gameplay

### ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Beginner-Friendly**: No programming or advanced math required
- 🎮 **Interactive Learning**: Learn by doing through engaging game mechanics
- 📊 **Visual Feedback**: Clear audiovisual cues help understand ML concepts
- 🏆 **Progressive Difficulty**: Four levels guide from basics to advanced concepts
- 🌟 **Positive Reinforcement**: Encouraging rewards motivate continued learning

### 🔬 Research Background

Published at **CHI 2022** (Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems), this game addresses the growing need for ML education among non-technical students. Playtest results showed that players successfully learned basic ML concepts and understood how data impacts model results, while finding ML more approachable and relevant.

abstract = { As machine learning (ML) became more relevant to our lives, ML education for college students without technical background arose important. However, not many educational games designed to suit challenges they experience exist. We introduce an educational game Classy Trash Monster (CTM), designed to better educate ML and data dependency to non-major students who learn ML for the first time. The player can easily learn to train a classification model and solve tasks by engaging in simple game activities designed according to an ML pipeline. Simple controls, positive rewards, and clear audiovisual feedback makes game easy to play even for novice players. The playtest result showed that players were able to learn basic ML concepts and how data can impact model results, and that the game made ML feel less difficult and more relevant. However, proper debriefing session seems crucial to prevent misinterpretations that may occur in the learning process.},
